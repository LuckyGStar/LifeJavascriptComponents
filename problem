Sub Matrix Max Sum

Given  a rectangualr matrix m and an integer k, consider all the k * k contiguious square submatrices of m. Your task is the following:
  - calculate the sum of all numbers within each k * k submatrix
  - determine the maximum of all these sums
  - find all the distinct numbers that appear in at least one of the k * k submatrices wihth a sum equal to the maxiumum each integer from these squares should be calculated exactly once

return the sum of these distinct numbers

note: k * k contiguous square submatrix contains k2 cells and is built from intersection of k contiguous rows and k contiguous columns. 

see example for better understanding

1 0 1 5 6
3 3 0 3 3 
2 9 2 1 2
0 2 4 2 0

k = 2

output should be bestSquareas(m, k) = 29
if we consider all the 2 * 2 squares in m, there are 3 of them with a maximum sum of 17
among these 3 squares which each have the maximum sum, only th edistinct numbers 2,3,4,5,6, and 9 appear
